//https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/
//Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
//Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
//Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
//
//Example 2:
//Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
//Output: [[1,5]]
//Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
//
//NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.
