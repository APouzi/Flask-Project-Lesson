//https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/
//Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy". A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
//Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process
//until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers
//for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.
//Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.
//
//Example:
//Input: 19
//Output: true

//Explanation:
//12 + 92 = 82
//82 + 22 = 68
//62 + 82 = 100
//12 + 02 + 02 = 1
