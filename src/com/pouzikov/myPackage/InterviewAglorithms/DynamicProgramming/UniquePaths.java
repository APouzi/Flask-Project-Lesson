// A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below). The robot can only
//move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid
//(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
//
//How many possible unique paths are there?
//
//
//Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?
//

//Example 1:
//Input: m = 3, n = 2
//Output: 3
//Explanation:
//From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
//1. Right -> Right -> Down
//2. Right -> Down -> Right
//3. Down -> Right -> Right
//
//Example 2:
//Input: m = 7, n = 3
//Output: 28
//

//Constraints:
//1 <= m, n <= 100
//It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10 ^ 9.

//The idea is to use a 2D array to keep track of the total possible ways to enter specific block.
//Since we can only go "DOWN" and "RIGHT", therefore each block could be entered from both "ABOVE" and "LEFT", therefore
//adding up their total ways would give the total ways for current block.
